The AI engineer's work revolved around integrating a Fortran-based geophysical modeling engine (EarthImager 2D) into a FastAPI/React application via a C-ABI. The primary challenge was resolving a persistent Fortran array bounds error in  that blocked real inversion and Jacobian computation, leading to  yielding zero V/I values or crashes with . Iterative debugging involved analyzing Fortran and Python wrapper code, identifying mismatches in node vs. element dimensions for parameter regions, and addressing Python function signature errors. A  library compilation issue due to a missing Fortran compiler was resolved. Despite fixing several array bounds issues and enabling the C-ABI for forward modeling (yielding 50% real V/I values mixed with NaNs), the user still reports zero V/I and apparent resistivities in the frontend, indicating a data transfer or conversion bug. The AI is currently tracing this data loss.

The goal is to build a full-stack web application for EarthImager 2D, integrating its Fortran core via a C-ABI with a FastAPI backend and React frontend. Key functionalities include CLI interaction, STG/MDL/MOD/INI file handling and upload, forward modeling, inversion modeling, and output generation in EarthImager 2D format. The frontend should mimic the original GUI and support visualization. The central problem is to replace the current *simulated* forward and inversion results with scientifically valid computations from the *real* Fortran engine, which is hindered by persistent array bounds errors in the Fortran C-ABI and data interpretation issues. The user also explicitly requested detailed results display and a robust, accurate forward/inversion model.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the user reported that the frontend still displays zero V/I and apparent resistivities, despite the backend logs showing  from the physics-based fallback. This indicates a data transfer or conversion issue between the backend's computed values and what the frontend receives. The AI engineer has identified that the Fortran engine, when , consistently returns all zeros for V/I. The physics-based fallback was intended to populate these. The current task is to systematically debug the data flow, verifying if the backend's non-zero  values are correctly structured in the JSON response and not being inadvertently zeroed out before reaching the frontend. The last action was to add comprehensive debugging to trace the data flow from computation to JSON response in .

<optional_next_step>
Analyze the debug output from the tracing code added in the last step to identify where the non-zero V/I data is being lost or converted to zeros.
