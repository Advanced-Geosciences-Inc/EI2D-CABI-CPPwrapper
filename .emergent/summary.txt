The interaction began with an initial misunderstanding regarding the codebase, as the provided boilerplate was a generic React/FastAPI app, not the user's C-ABI+C++ project. After several exchanges on GitHub integration issues, the user uploaded a zipped project (). The core task then became integrating this Fortran-based geophysical modeling engine (EarthImager 2D) via a C-ABI into the existing FastAPI backend and React frontend.

Key challenges involved debugging the C-ABI integration, specifically array bounds and data type mismatches between Python and Fortran, and ensuring proper file parsing for INI, STG, MDL, and MOD files. The AI engineer iteratively built out the backend services for forward modeling and inversion, implemented file upload/parsing, and designed the frontend UI to mimic EarthImager 2D's GUI. Validation and debugging tools were added to verify data flow. The trajectory concludes with the integration of user-provided Python plotting code for visualization, and the next step is installing necessary dependencies for this.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build a command-line interface (CLI) backend for the EarthImager 2D application, leveraging a pre-existing C-ABI and C++ wrapper. This CLI version needs to interface with an already built React frontend.

Key functionalities required:
1.  **CLI Interface**: Test and deploy a CLI using the C-ABI+C++ foundation.
2.  **File Handling**: Read STG (survey), MDL (mesh/model), MOD (resistivity model), and INI (parameters) files.
3.  **Forward Modeling**: Run forward modeling calculations using existing Fortran routines via the C-ABI. The frontend should allow defining parameters (electrodes, spacing, resistivity) and display calculated apparent resistivities.
4.  **Inversion Modeling**: Implement the full inversion workflow, including grid generation, initial model assignment, running selected inversion methods (PCGLS/OC/Robust), and generating inversion results.
5.  **Output**: Generate  files containing inversion results (grid geometry, resistivities, apparent resistivities, errors).
6.  **Frontend Mimicry**: The React frontend must mimic the Windows GUI of the original EarthImager 2D application, displaying parsed data, input parameters, and output results.
7.  **Visualization**: Integrate user-provided Python code to read OUT files and generate plots for display on the frontend.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was integrating the user-provided Python plotting code () for visualization purposes. This involved:

1.  **Downloading and analyzing** the  script.
2.  **Creating a new backend service file**, , to wrap the plotting functionalities of the  script, making them accessible via API.
3.  **Adding new API endpoints** in  to expose these visualization services (e.g., ).
4.  **Updating the React frontend ()** to include UI elements that will trigger these new visualization endpoints and display the generated plots. This included modifications to the Results tab and potentially other UI components to allow users to request and view plots.

The last action recorded was , indicating that the code changes for visualization integration are complete, but the necessary Python libraries for  (like , , ) still need to be installed in the backend environment.
