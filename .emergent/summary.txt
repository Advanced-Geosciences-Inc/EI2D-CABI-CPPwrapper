The AI engineer's work began with integrating a Fortran-based geophysical modeling engine (EarthImager 2D) via a C-ABI into an existing FastAPI backend and React frontend. After initial environment setup, the core task shifted from generic React/FastAPI to a specialized C-ABI+C++ project. Key challenges involved debugging the C-ABI, data type mismatches, and ensuring file parsing for INI, STG, MDL, MOD files. The engineer iteratively developed backend services for forward modeling and inversion, implemented file upload/parsing, and designed the frontend to mimic EarthImager 2D's GUI.

Validation and debugging tools were added to verify data flow. A user-provided Python plotting script was integrated for visualization, but issues with its parsing logic and the quality of the backend's *simulated* inversion results led to iterative improvements in the Python parser and the simulation model itself. The trajectory revealed that the backend was using a *simulated* inversion due to a persistent Fortran array bounds error in  within the C-ABI integration. The AI acknowledged this, and the current focus is on systematically debugging this Fortran array bounds error, analyzing Fortran source, and aligning array sizes in the C-ABI interface.

The primary goal is to develop a full-stack web application for EarthImager 2D, leveraging its Fortran-based geophysical modeling engine through a C-ABI (C Application Binary Interface) and a C++ wrapper. The application needs to integrate this scientific core with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.

Key functionalities and implementation details so far:
1.  **CLI Interface**: The core Fortran engine is wrapped via C-ABI, with Python bindings in the backend.
2.  **File Handling**: The application reads STG (survey), MDL (mesh/model), MOD (resistivity model), and INI (parameters) files. File upload endpoints are implemented in the backend, and the frontend provides UI for these uploads.
3.  **Forward Modeling**: Backend services exist to run forward modeling, and the frontend allows parameter definition and displays apparent resistivities.
4.  **Inversion Modeling**: A *simulated* inversion workflow is implemented, which generates results programmatically due to a persistent Fortran C-ABI error. The frontend provides an Inversion Settings tab and a Run Full Inversion button.
5.  **Output**: Generates  files containing inversion results (grid geometry, resistivities, apparent resistivities, errors) in a format closely matching EarthImager 2D, including iteration data, resistivity, and sensitivity matrices.
6.  **Frontend Mimicry**: The React frontend mimics the original EarthImager 2D GUI, displaying parsed data, input parameters, and inversion results (iterations, RMS, convergence).
7.  **Visualization**: A user-provided Python script () for plotting OUT files has been adapted () to handle variable grid dimensions and apply EarthImager 2D-specific ROI (Region of Interest) filtering. The frontend supports downloading the generated OUT file for local plotting.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a critical debugging task: resolving a persistent **Fortran array bounds error** that prevents the actual EarthImager 2D inversion routines () from being called via the C-ABI. This error, specifically occurring at , indicates an  issue, suggesting a mismatch between calculated array sizes and what the Fortran code expects.

The previous work involved extensive efforts to:
1.  **Acknowledge and clarify** to the user that the inversion results so far were *simulated*, not from the actual Fortran engine, due to this blocking error.
2.  **Collect additional diagnostic information** from the user, including , which contained documentation and file structure (). The AI processed this, including converting a UTF-16 file to UTF-8.
3.  **Perform detailed source code analysis** of the Fortran files within , specifically  and .
4.  **Identify the root cause of the error**: The  array is allocated as  (in  line 288), but the index  (calculated as  on line 349 of ) can potentially exceed . This means there is a mismatch in how element indices are being calculated or how the array is being dimensioned based on the mesh parameters passed from Python.

The AI engineer's last action was to search the  file to understand how the global variables, specifically those related to array sizing (e.g., , ), are being set when  is called. The goal is to correct the array sizing and indexing logic in the Python C-ABI wrapper to align with Fortran's expectations, thereby resolving the array bounds error and enabling real inversion.
