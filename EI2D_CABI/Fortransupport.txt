In order to run Volente on a system support files for Fortran must exist.
These files will be installed using the VFRUN660I.exe setup file that is
downloaded from Compaq's website on URL:
     http://www.compaq.com/fortran/kb/q1023.html
     http://www.compaq.com/fortran/visual/redist.html

The following is an excerpt from that webpage.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The self-installing executable kit on this page installs the run-time components
needed to run Visual Fortran applications on systems which do not have
Visual Fortran installed.
The components installed by this kit are: 

DFORRT.DLL - Visual Fortran non-threaded run-time support 
DFORMD.DLL - Visual Fortran threaded run-time support 
FQWIN.HLP - QuickWin run-time help file 
MSVCRT.DLL - Microsoft Visual C run-time support 
OLEAUT32.DLL - Microsoft OLE Automation 
OLEPRO32.DLL - Microsoft OLE Automation 
STDOLE32.TLB - Microsoft OLE Automation
 
Files will be installed only if newer versions do not exist on the system.
The files in this kit are the same as in Compaq Visual Fortran 6.5A, and can
be used with earlier versions of Visual Fortran.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After checking up on the requirements it turns out that the files *really* needed are:

Visual Fortran files:
DFORRT.DLL - Visual Fortran non-threaded run-time support 
DFORMD.DLL - Visual Fortran threaded run-time support
DFORRTD.DLL - Don't know the use of this file 

Microsoft system files:
MSVCRT.DLL - Microsoft Visual C run-time support 
OLEAUT32.DLL - Microsoft OLE Automation 
OLEPRO32.DLL - Microsoft OLE Automation 
STDOLE32.TLB - Microsoft OLE Automation
MSVCRTD.DLL - Microsoft C run-time library

These files must be installed on the target system, preferably in the system32 directory.
